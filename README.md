# Closeness

A simple application implementing the process described in the paper by [The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness: A Procedure and Some Preliminary Findings](https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167297234003).

This is a method designed to create a feeling of closeness between two strangers by getting to know one another on a gradually deeper level. It consists of 36 questions split into three sets of 12. Each set of questions grows successively more personal, starting with small talk and eventually progressing to potentially sensitive topics. (I'm a programmer, not a psycologist; read the paper if you want to know more.)

Basically, if you're on a first date and don't mind being a total nerd; it's a great way to see if the potential relationship...has potential.

Like I said, I'm a programmer.

## Building

The application is made with Flutter, and therefore should in theory support all major platforms. In practice, I only intend to test on Linux and build for Android. The [flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android) should have all the relevant details.
